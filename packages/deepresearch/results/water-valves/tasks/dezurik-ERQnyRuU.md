# Manufacturing Outreach Deep Research Prompt

You are researching a manufacturing company so Cronwell can decide whether and how to reach out.

Cronwell helps manufacturers automate procurement workflows with agents. The best prospects are companies with real manufacturing operations, complex supplier bases, many SKUs or engineered parts, recent growth or operational change, and enough procurement complexity that automation could matter.

Research the company using recent public web sources, not only its website. Prioritize company pages, press releases, SEC filings if applicable, parent company pages, acquisition announcements, facility-expansion news, distributor/product catalogues, LinkedIn/company pages, trade publications, local business journals, and credible industry sources.

Answer these questions:

1. What does the company manufacture or sell? Include notable product lines, catalog breadth, and whether it appears to make valves, waterworks, flow-control, plumbing, or related industrial products.
2. What evidence exists that it owns or operates manufacturing facilities, assembly operations, engineering, or high-mix production?
3. What recent trigger events matter for outreach? Look for acquisitions, ownership changes, M&A activity, plant expansions, new facilities, hiring, new product lines, supply-chain pressure, certifications, or major customer/market moves.
4. Who is the best likely buyer or influencer for a procurement-automation pitch? Use the provided lead if present, but override it if public evidence suggests a better executive or role.
5. What personalized outreach angle should Cronwell use? Make it specific to the company’s current situation, not a generic procurement pitch.
6. What is the company's likely org chart around manufacturing, procurement, supply chain, operations, engineering, finance, and executive leadership? Reconstruct this as best as possible from public sources. Include parent-company reporting lines where relevant, mark inferred relationships clearly, and include confidence for each person or role.

Use `fit_score` from 1 to 5:

- 5: clearly a strong manufacturing/procurement prospect with relevant recent trigger.
- 4: strong manufacturing fit, trigger or buyer likely but not fully confirmed.
- 3: plausible manufacturer, but procurement complexity or timing is uncertain.
- 2: weak fit or mainly distributor/service business.
- 1: not a relevant manufacturer or insufficient evidence.
